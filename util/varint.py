"""Encode and decode VARINTs in Python

Just wrote this while trying to understand exactly how VARINTs work. Maybe
someone else will find this useful too.

Here's where I was reading about VARINTs:

def encode_varint(value):
    """Encodes a single Python integer to a VARINT."""
    return "".join(encode_varint_stream([value]))


def decode_varint(value):
    """Decodes a single Python integer from a VARINT.

    Note that `value` may be a stream containing more than a single
    encoded VARINT. Only the first VARINT will be decoded and returned. If
    you expect to be handling multiple VARINTs in a stream you might want to
    use the `decode_varint_stream` function directly.
